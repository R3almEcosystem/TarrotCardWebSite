# Roadmap

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Planning rule

This roadmap is capability-based and intentionally has no invented delivery dates. Product owners convert phases into dated commitments only after dependencies, capacity, evidence, and risk approvals are known.

| Phase | Outcome | Exit evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — Baseline | Ownership, scope, architecture, risks, and measures agreed | Approved docs and ADRs | In progress |
| 1 — Core workflow | start session → select cards → interpret → review works end to end in an isolated environment | Acceptance and failure-path tests | Planned |
| 2 — Trust controls | Access, security, lineage, audit, and operational controls verified | Control evidence and incident exercise | Planned |
| 3 — Integration | Required ecosystem/provider contracts operate safely | Compatibility, retry, and degraded-mode tests | Planned |
| 4 — Production readiness | Reliability, accessibility, support, and recovery are proven | Release review and monitored rollout | Planned |
| 5 — Learning | Real usage improves value without weakening controls | Measured outcomes and reviewed experiments | Planned |

## Prioritization

Prioritize user harm reduction and integrity first, then core outcome, reliability, operability, and optimization. Every roadmap item names an owner, metric, dependencies, risks, and rollback or stop condition.
