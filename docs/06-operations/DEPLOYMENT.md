# Deployment

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Release model

Build once from a reviewed commit, promote the same immutable artifact through isolated environments, and record provenance. The repository's workflow configuration is authoritative; no hosting provider is selected by this baseline.

## Pipeline stages

1. Validate formatting, types or compilation, tests, and documentation.
2. Scan dependencies, secrets, source, and build artifacts.
3. Build with pinned tools and a reproducible dependency graph.
4. Deploy to an isolated preview or development environment.
5. Run smoke, integration, authorization, accessibility, and migration checks.
6. Require owner approval for production based on risk.
7. Deploy progressively when supported; monitor the change window.
8. Roll back or roll forward using the rehearsed path.

## Data safety

Schema changes use reviewed versioned migrations. Backfills are separate, observable jobs. Deployment must never erase existing records to resolve drift. Destructive changes require explicit approval, backup verification, consumer migration, and a recovery test.

## Release record

Capture commit, artifact digest, environment, migration set, configuration version, approver, timestamps, checks, dashboards, incidents, and rollback outcome.
