# Operations Runbook

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## First response

1. Confirm the alert and affected TarrotCardWebSite workflow.
2. Declare an owner, severity, start time, and communication channel.
3. Protect users and data: disable the risky path, revoke exposed credentials, or enter read-only/degraded mode.
4. Preserve correlation IDs, deployment/configuration versions, logs, traces, and audit evidence.
5. Check recent releases, migrations, dependency health, capacity, and security signals.
6. Mitigate with a rehearsed rollback, failover, queue pause, feature disable, or rate limit.
7. Verify recovery with user-facing and backend checks.
8. Communicate status, then complete a blameless review and tracked actions.

## Symptom matrix

| Symptom | Initial checks | Safe action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application unavailable | Health, DNS, deploy, saturation, dependency status | Roll back or degrade |
| Elevated errors | Error class, route, release, integration | Disable affected path |
| Stale/inconsistent data | Source freshness, jobs, migrations, reconciliation | Stop writes if integrity is uncertain |
| Authorization anomaly | Identity, policy, tenant scope, audit events | Contain access and escalate security |
| Unexpected automated output | Version, inputs, evaluation/guardrails | Disable model/feature and preserve evidence |

## Contacts and commands

Populate verified on-call contacts, dashboards, status page, deployment controls, backup/restore steps, and environment-specific commands before production. Do not put secrets in the runbook.
