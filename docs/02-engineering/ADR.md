# Architecture Decision Records

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Policy

Use an ADR for decisions that are expensive to reverse, affect security or data, establish a shared contract, introduce a vendor, change runtime topology, or constrain future work. Existing ADRs are append-only; supersede them with a new decision instead of erasing history.

## Index

| ID | Decision | Status | Date | Supersedes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ADR-000 | Adopt the nine-layer repository documentation baseline | Accepted | 2026-09-10 | — |
| ADR-001 | First application-specific decision | Proposed | TBD | — |

## Context
What forces and constraints require a decision?

## Decision
What is being chosen, at which boundary, and for how long?

## Alternatives
What credible options were considered?

## Consequences
Benefits, costs, risks, migration, observability, and rollback.

## Evidence
Tests, measurements, reviews, and links.
```

## ADR-000 rationale

The canonical structure makes TarrotCardWebSite discoverable in R3alm Hub and gives engineering, product, operations, security, and governance a shared versioned source. It does not replace repository-specific decisions.
