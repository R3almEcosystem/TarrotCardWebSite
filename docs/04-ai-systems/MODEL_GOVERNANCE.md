# Model Governance

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Governance objective

Automated assistance must remain proportionate to user impact, reviewable, and reversible where feasible. Product speed does not waive privacy, security, safety, fairness, intellectual-property, or recordkeeping requirements.

## Lifecycle gates

| Gate | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Proposal | Use case, owner, affected users, impact tier, alternatives |
| Data review | Source rights, minimization, sensitive classes, retention |
| Evaluation | Representative tests, thresholds, failure analysis, red-team cases |
| Release | Registry entry, human oversight, fallback, monitoring, disable switch |
| Operation | Quality, drift, safety, latency, cost, complaints, incidents |
| Change/retire | Re-evaluation, migration, evidence retention, consumer notice |

## Accountability

A named human owner approves release and remains responsible for outcomes. High-impact decisions require meaningful review or deterministic controls. Users must not be misled about generated content or certainty.

## Incident response

On unsafe output, unexplained performance change, data exposure, or provider compromise: disable or contain the feature, preserve evidence, notify the incident owner, assess affected records, communicate as required, remediate, and re-evaluate before restoration.
