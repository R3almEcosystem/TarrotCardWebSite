# Risk Framework

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Method

Score **likelihood** and **impact** from 1 (low) to 5 (critical); inherent risk is their product. Record existing controls, evidence, residual score, owner, treatment, due date, and acceptance authority. Reassess on material change or incident.

## Initial risk register

| Risk | Inherent concern | Required treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unauthorized access or cross-scope data | Confidentiality and integrity | Server-side authorization, negative tests, audit |
| Invalid workflow transition | Incorrect reading outcome | Domain state machine and concurrency controls |
| Dependency failure or replay | Duplicate or partial side effects | Idempotency, timeout, reconciliation, degraded mode |
| Data misuse or over-retention | Privacy, legal, and trust harm | Inventory, minimization, retention, deletion tests |
| Supply-chain compromise | Code or credential compromise | Lockfiles, scanning, provenance, least privilege |
| Operational blind spot | Slow detection and recovery | SLIs, actionable alerts, rehearsed runbook |
| Unreviewed automation introduced later | Decision and trust harm | Model registry and governance gate before use |

## Treatment

Avoid the activity, reduce likelihood or impact, transfer contractually where appropriate, or explicitly accept residual risk. High or critical residual risk cannot be silently accepted by the implementation team. Link accepted risk to an accountable owner and review date.
