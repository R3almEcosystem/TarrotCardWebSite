# Audit Trail Specification

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Objective

Provide trustworthy evidence for security, governance, and material interactive card-reading experiences events without turning the audit trail into a second store of sensitive content.

## Event schema

| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| event_id | Globally unique, immutable |
| occurred_at | Trusted UTC timestamp |
| recorded_at | Ingestion timestamp |
| actor | Stable pseudonymous user/workload reference |
| tenant/scope | Authorization boundary where applicable |
| action | Versioned verb |
| target | Type and stable identifier |
| before/after | Minimal changed fields or hashes, not full sensitive records |
| outcome | Success, denial, failure, or partial |
| reason | Stable code plus approved free text |
| correlation_id | Link to request/workflow |
| source/version | Service, commit/artifact, rule or model version |
| integrity | Append-only control, hash, signature, or equivalent evidence |

## Events to record

Authentication and session changes; grants and revocations; privileged reads or exports; reading creation and material transitions; approvals and overrides; integration dispatch and receipt; configuration, model, policy, schema, deployment, and retention changes; security incidents and emergency actions.

## Protection and access

Audit writes must not depend on the user's ability to modify the target record. Restrict audit readers, monitor access, define retention and legal hold, synchronize time, and test completeness. Corrections append a new event; they never erase history. Define export and verification procedures before relying on the trail for compliance.
