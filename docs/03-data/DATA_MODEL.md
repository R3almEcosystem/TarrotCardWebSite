# Data Model

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Conceptual entities

| Entity | Purpose | Key relationship |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Principal | Authenticated person or workload | Acts under assigned roles |
| Reading | Primary unit for interactive card-reading experiences | Owned, submitted, or processed by a principal |
| Workflow Event | State transition with reason and time | Belongs to one reading |
| Evidence | Source, review, or output supporting a decision | References a workflow event |
| Integration Receipt | External request/response status | Correlates without exposing sensitive payloads |
| Audit Event | Security- or governance-relevant action | Links actor, target, action, and outcome |

## Invariants

- Identifiers remain stable across versions and integrations.
- State transitions follow an explicit finite set and cannot skip required approvals.
- User-visible status is derived from authoritative state.
- Material outputs retain provenance to the applicable inputs, rules, and version.
- Deletion, anonymization, and retention preserve required audit evidence without retaining unnecessary content.

## Ownership

Assign one accountable owner to every entity and field group. The owner approves meaning, access, quality checks, retention, and change compatibility. Translate this conceptual model into implementation-specific schema documentation only after validating the code and migrations.
