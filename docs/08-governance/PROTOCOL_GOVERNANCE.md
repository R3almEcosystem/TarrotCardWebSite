# Protocol Governance

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Scope

Governance covers product policy, architecture, data definitions, integrations, security controls, automated decisions, deployment, and this documentation. Git history preserves versions; material decisions link to an ADR or approved change record.

## Decision rights

| Decision | Accountable owner | Required reviewers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product behavior | Product owner | Engineering, design |
| Architecture/contract | Engineering owner | Affected service owners |
| Data collection/retention | Data owner | Privacy/security/compliance |
| Access/security control | Security owner | Engineering/operations |
| Model or automated decision | Model risk owner | Product, data, security |
| Production release | Service owner | Operations and risk-based approvers |
| Emergency change | Incident commander | Retrospective reviewers |

## Change process

Propose with impact and evidence; identify affected users, data, consumers, and obligations; review for security, privacy, reliability, and compatibility; approve by accountable owners; implement behind a safe rollout; observe against success and stop conditions; retain the decision and outcome.

## Emergency changes

Contain harm first using the smallest reversible action. Record actor, reason, scope, time, evidence, and follow-up. Emergency authority expires with the incident and does not bypass retrospective review.
