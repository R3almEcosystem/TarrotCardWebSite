# Integration Map

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Contract inventory

No integration is approved merely because it appears in catalog metadata. Add every verified dependency to this table before production use.

| Integration | Direction | Data exchanged | Authentication | Failure owner | Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Identity provider | Inbound | Principal and session claims | TBD | Application owner | TBD |
| Primary data store | Bidirectional | session choices, card content, generated interpretations, and minimal telemetry | Workload identity / secret | Data owner | TBD |
| Telemetry sink | Outbound | Redacted operational events | Workload identity | Operations | TBD |
| Product-specific service | TBD | Contract to be documented | TBD | Named owner required | TBD |

## Boundary requirements

1. Validate schemas on ingress and egress.
2. Use least-privilege credentials with documented rotation.
3. Set timeouts and retry only operations proven safe to repeat.
4. Record data classification, residency, retention, and deletion behavior.
5. Propagate a correlation ID without exposing secrets or regulated payloads.
6. Provide a tested degraded mode or explicit unavailable state.

## Change procedure

A contract change requires an owner, compatibility assessment, consumer inventory, rollout plan, observation window, and rollback path. Breaking changes receive a new version and cannot silently replace a contract still in use.
