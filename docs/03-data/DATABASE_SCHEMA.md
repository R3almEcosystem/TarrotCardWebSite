# Database Schema

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Authoritative schema

This baseline does not infer tables from product language. The authoritative schema is the repository's versioned migrations and generated schema output. If no migrations exist, schema design remains **TBD**.

## Required record fields

Any persisted reading should have an immutable identifier, explicit lifecycle state, created and updated timestamps, actor or source attribution where lawful, and a concurrency strategy. Use domain-specific fields only after data classification and ownership are recorded.

## Schema rules

- Apply changes through forward-only, reviewed migrations.
- Add constraints for invariants; do not rely only on interface validation.
- Index measured access paths and verify query plans at realistic volume.
- Scope tenant-owned records and enforce authorization at the data boundary where supported.
- Separate secrets and highly sensitive values from general application state.
- Define deletion and retention behavior before collecting a field.
- Back up and test restore procedures for durable data.

## Change checklist

For each migration record compatibility, lock or downtime risk, backfill plan, validation query, rollback or roll-forward plan, retention impact, access-policy updates, and monitoring. Destructive changes require an explicit approval window and verified backup; documentation work must never erase existing data.
