# Security

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Security objectives

Protect session choices, card content, generated interpretations, and minimal telemetry; prevent unauthorized workflow transitions; preserve availability and integrity; and produce evidence sufficient to investigate material events.

## Minimum controls

| Area | Baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | Central authentication, short-lived sessions, MFA for privileged access |
| Authorization | Server-side least privilege; deny by default |
| Secrets | Approved secret manager; rotation and exposure response |
| Transport/storage | Current secure transport; provider-backed encryption with managed keys |
| Input | Schema validation, output encoding, file/content controls as applicable |
| Dependencies | Locked versions, automated scanning, timely remediation |
| Delivery | Reviewed changes, isolated environments, artifact provenance |
| Detection | Redacted logs, security alerts, audit events, incident ownership |

## Threat review

Assess account takeover, privilege escalation, injection, cross-tenant access, secret leakage, supply-chain compromise, unsafe file or URL handling, replay, denial of service, dependency outage, and integrity loss. Add domain-specific abuse cases for interactive card-reading experiences.

## Verification

Before production, capture threat model, authorization tests, dependency and secret scans, security headers or API controls, backup/restore evidence, incident exercise, and accepted residual risks. Never record real secrets in this document.
