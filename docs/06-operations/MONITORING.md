# Monitoring

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Service-level signals

Monitor availability, latency, error rate, saturation, and the success rate and duration of the primary workflow **start session → select cards → interpret → review**. Add dependency health and data freshness for every critical source.

## Minimum telemetry

| Signal | Dimensions | Alert intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Request/workflow count | outcome, operation, environment | Detect demand and failures |
| Latency/duration | operation, dependency | Detect user-impacting slowdown |
| Error rate | stable error code, boundary | Detect regressions |
| Saturation | compute, connection, queue, quota | Prevent exhaustion |
| Data freshness/quality | source, dataset, rule | Detect stale or invalid results |
| Security events | action, outcome, risk class | Detect abuse without exposing payloads |
| Deployment marker | commit/artifact/config | Correlate changes |

## Logging rules

Use structured timestamps, severity, service, environment, correlation ID, operation, stable outcome code, and safe actor/tenant references. Never log secrets, tokens, credentials, full personal records, private content, or raw model prompts/outputs unless explicitly approved and protected.

## Alerts

Each paging alert needs a user-impact statement, threshold based on observed behavior, owner, runbook link, and recovery signal. Review noisy or unused alerts and track detection and recovery time.
