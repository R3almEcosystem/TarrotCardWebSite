# Data Governance

> TarrotCardWebSite · Platform · Pre-Alpha

TarrotCardWebSite is cataloged as a Platform application focused on interactive card-reading experiences.

> **Baseline notice:** This document defines the expected operating standard. It does not claim that a control, integration, model, or certification is already implemented; verify the code, configuration, and production evidence before release.

## Scope

Potential data includes session choices, card content, generated interpretations, and minimal telemetry. Actual collection must be derived from verified interfaces, schemas, telemetry, and integrations, then entered in the data inventory.

## Governance rules

- Collect only data necessary for an approved purpose.
- Assign owner, classification, access, retention, and deletion behavior before collection.
- Separate production data from development and analytics use.
- Use synthetic or de-identified fixtures for testing.
- Honor correction, export, deletion, legal hold, and consent obligations where applicable.
- Do not place sensitive payloads in logs, URLs, analytics events, or model prompts without approval.
- Preserve versioned provenance for material records and derived outputs.

## Retention register

| Data class | Purpose | Owner | Retention | Deletion method | Legal hold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Account/identity metadata | Access and attribution | TBD | TBD | Delete or anonymize | TBD |
| Reading content/state | Product workflow | TBD | TBD | Domain-specific | TBD |
| Operational telemetry | Reliability and security | Operations | TBD | Expire | TBD |
| Audit evidence | Accountability | Governance | TBD | Controlled expiry | Supported |

Retention values remain TBD until product, legal, security, and data owners approve them.
